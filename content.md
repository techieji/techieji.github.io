# Hello, World!

Hi! I'm Pradhyum, a student at Cornell University.
I'm currently studying **Computer Science** (and hopefully
also **Physics**).

Here are some things I hope to do:

* Build a [compiler](https://github.com/techieji/shuffle)
* Make my own distro (coming soon... hopefully)
* Build a phased-array for radio astronomy
* Translate Ovid's *Remedia Amoris* (not that I need it...)

Here are some things I've done:

* Built an [interpreter](https://github.com/techieji/aesthetic)
* Made a [game that won for best software at Big Red Hacks 2025](https://serendipity-bigredhacks.vercel.app/)
* Made a simple [digital geometry box](https://github.com/techieji/geometer) for use with LaTeX
* Published a [translation of some Vitruvius](https://www.elainos.classics.cornell.edu/s/Fall-2025-Ed-2-Elainos.pdf) with a friend

Positions I've held/hold:

* Course consultant for *Mathematics for Computer Science* (CS2800)
* CCDC competitor, [Cornell Cybersecurity Club](https://cornellcyber.club)
* Plasma science researcher at the NRL
* President of my high school's Science Olympiad club

There are too many interesting things out there:
the [synthesis kernel](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/nyu/04fa/sched/readings/synthesis.pdf) to
[tropical geometry](https://people.math.osu.edu/katz.60/whatistropical.pdf),
[combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic)
to literally [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/)! And lest you think that
I only find CS interesting, I'll have you know that I seriously enjoy reading:
I really, really like *Walden* and [anything by Borges](https://core.ecu.edu/parillek/DeathandCompass.pdf).
**My one goal is to add something of my own to this list!**
