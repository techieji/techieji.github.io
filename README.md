# Portfolio website

A lot of the stuff was written by Claude, but I will say that I was the one
who architected the design and wrote the specification! (I cannot touch
CSS without AI...)

Usage: `template.html` contains a basic template file that can be modified
to edit the sidebar. Run `python generator.py` on a markdown file to compile
the markdown into an html file with the sidebar. It's simple and minimalist.
